# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project was to refactor the code we wrote in module 2. The code written in module 2 was inefficient  (2 pt).


## Results 
Refactoring our code made a drastic improvment in the run time of our code. As you can see in these images  ![module exercise 2017](https://github.com/tylersojka/Stock-Analysis/blob/master/Resources/Unrefactored_2017.png)
![module exercise 2018](https://github.com/tylersojka/Stock-Analysis/blob/master/Resources/Unrefactored_2018.png) my unfactored, original module 2 run times were 0.64 seconds and 0.65 seconds for 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
<br>
After the refactoring of the code, you can see from these screenshots ![VBA_Challenge 2017](https://github.com/tylersojka/Stock-Analysis/blob/master/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)
![VBA_Challenge 2018](https://github.com/tylersojka/Stock-Analysis/blob/master/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png) the run times for 2017 and 2018, were both 0.15 seconds. 
<br>
With just this refactoring, the code is now executed 426% faster.

The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
